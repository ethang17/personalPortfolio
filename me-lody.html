                <p>As part of my third term at Drexel, I particpated in a course called Computer Informatics 3. It was a course built upon the back of a class I previously had, aptly named Computer Informatics 2.
                    These courses sought to lead us through the creation of some sort of program. I, along with three other students, worked on a project called Me-Lody. The idea was similar to an app that took the world by storm in 2022, BeReal.
                    In that app, users post a photo when the get a notification at a random time during the day. Ours was similar, but instead, a user would post a song they were either listening to at the time of the notification or had before. Rushed by the short planning phase of the build,
                    we decided on using React Native along with Expo Go to create and test a webapp. Underwhelmed and unfamiliar with tools we had decided to use, we jumped right in. We utilized YouTube tutorials, documentation, and templates in order to get
                    a minimum viable product - at least one that was as close to our goals as we could. This project aided me in learning some front end techniques as well as the impressive capabilities of Typescript, React Native, and Expo Go. 
                    <br><br>
                    My largest contributions to the app were the ability to make multiple screens, interconnected, being able to create the song "tiles" which displayed on your home screen, as well as making the friend system. 
                    To be clear, these were entirely proof of concept and derived from arrays, but they show my understanding of fundamental concepts of programming. I also learned how to work hard towards a goal. I came to become the person working on the project that made the most progress.
                    As shown before I made more commits than the other three students combined. I learned good principles of programming thorugh the use of Gitlab. This includes using different branches for different features, committing whenever progress is made, and merging to combine all of these features in an incremental way.
