                <p>As part of my third term at Drexel, I participated in a course called Computer Informatics 3, 
                    which built upon the foundation laid in a previous class aptly named Computer Informatics 2. 
                    These courses aimed to guide us through the creation of a program. I, along with three other 
                    students, worked on a project called Me-Lody. The idea was similar to an app that gained popularity 
                    in 2022, BeReal. In that app, users post a photo when they receive a notification at a random time 
                    during the day. Ours was similar, but instead, a user would post a song they were either listening 
                    to at the time of the notification or had listened to before. Rushed by the short planning phase of 
                    the build, we decided to use React Native along with Expo Go to create and test a web app. Underwhelmed 
                    and unfamiliar with the tools we had decided to use, we jumped right in. We utilized YouTube tutorials, 
                    documentation, and templates to create a minimum viable product - at least one that was as close to our 
                    goals as possible. This project helped me learn some front-end techniques as well as the impressive capabilities 
                    of TypeScript, React Native, and Expo Go.
                    <br><br>
                    My largest contributions to the app were the ability to create multiple interconnected screens, 
                    the creation of the song "tiles" displayed on the home screen, and the implementation of the friend system. 
                    To clarify, these were entirely proof of concept and derived from arrays, but they demonstrate my 
                    understanding of fundamental programming concepts. I also learned how to work diligently towards a goal. 
                    I became the team member who made the most progress on the project. As evidenced by my making more commits 
                    \than the other three students combined, I learned good programming principles through the use of GitLab. 
                    This includes using different branches for different features, committing whenever progress is made, and 
                    merging to combine all of these features incrementally.
