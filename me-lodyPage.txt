About:
Me-lody was a project creaeted during my first year of university in my Computer Informatics class. 
The idea of the app was to be abel to share what music you are listening to in the moment. 
At a random time during the day, you would get a notification to either, if you are currently listening to music, you can share what song you are currently listening to. 
If you are not listening to music, you can share the alst song you listened to. 
The idea came about in the later months of 2022. A similar app called Airbuds rose to popularity in the months follwoing, showing strength of idea.

How was it made:
The app was written primarily in Typescript. Using Expo Go, we were able to create a template app that we cold the build off of.
Myself, along with three other students of the class worked together in order to create this version of an app.
