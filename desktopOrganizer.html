                <p>The 'Desktop Cleanup' program was developed during my first co-op. It was created to address 
                    the issue I, as an IT professional, encountered of end users having too many files on their desktops.
                     Often, these were not even files the user needed, but it was too cumbersome for them to resolve the issue.

                    With my previous programming experience primarily in Python, I decided to tackle the problem using my existing
                     knowledge. The program utilizes the tkinter GUI to make it more accessible. Considering my experience with average 
                     end users, the idea of them using a command-line program is less than ideal.
                    
                    One of my major concerns with this program is simply the sorting feature. If I were to remake this program, 
                    I would likely write it in a different format to better facilitate a front end. Additionally, I would want to 
                    incorporate some of these features:
                    </p>    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sorting by Date Range</li>
                        <li>Sorting by Keyword</li>
                        <li>Selecting Files to not Sort</li>
                    </ul>
