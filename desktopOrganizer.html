                <p>The "Desktop Cleanup" program was made during my frist co-op. It was done in order to address the problem, I as an IT professional found of end users having far too many files on their desktop.
                    Often time these were nto even files that the ser needed, but it would just be too cumbersome for the user to go through the trouble of fixing the issue.
                    With my previous programming experience being primarily in Python, I decided I would look to solve the problem with my current knowledge. The program uses the tkinter GUI to make it more accessible. 
                    The idea of the average end user using a program at the commandline is unideal given my experience with them. <br><br>
                    Some of my biggest qualms with this program is simply the sorting feature. If I were to remake this program, I would likely write it in a different fomrat to better be facilitated for a front end. I also 
                    woudl want to add some of these features:

                        <li>Sorting by Date Range</li>
                        <li>Sorting by Keyword</li>
                        <li>Selecting Files to not Sort</li>
